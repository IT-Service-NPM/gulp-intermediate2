A gulp helper for tools that need files on disk.

Some tools require access to files on disk instead of working with `stdin` and `stdout`
(e.g., [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Ruby Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)).
`gulp-intermediate2` is a convenience plugin
that writes the current vinyl stream to a temporary directory,
lets you run commands on the file system, and pushes the results back into the pipe.

**NOTE:** Writing intermediate files to disk is counter to the gulp philosophy.
If possible, use a tool that works with streams.
Use `gulp-intermediate2` only if other (better) options aren't available.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev gulp-intermediate2
```

## Usage

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var spawn = require('child-process').spawn;
var intermediate = require('gulp-intermediate2');

gulp.task('default', function () {
  return gulp.src('app/**/*.jade')
    .pipe(intermediate({ output: '_site' }, function (tempDir, cb) {
      // Run a command on the files in tempDir and write the results to
      // the specified output directory.
      var command = spawn('a_command', ['--dest', '_site'], {cwd: tempDir});
      command.on('close', cb);
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});
```

## API

### intermediate([options], [process])

#### options

Type: `object`
Optional

##### output

Type: `string`
Default: `'.'`

The directory read back into the stream when processing is finished.
Relative to `tempDir`.

##### container

Type: `string`
Default: random uuid

The directory that files are written to, relative to
the operating system's temporary directory.
Defaults to a unique random directory on every run.

The container is emptied before every run.

#### process(tempDir, cb, [fileProps])

Type: `function`
Optional

Run your commands inside the `process` callback.
`process` comes with three arguments:

- `tempDir`: The absolute path to the directory containing your temporary files.
  If using `spawn` you may want to set the `cwd` option to `tempDir`.
- `cb`: A callback function to call when the processing is finished.
  It pushes the output files back into the gulp stream.
- `fileProps`: An object with some information about the files
  that have been written to the temp directory.
  - `fileProps.cwd`: The original vinyl CWD.

#### Notes

The files are written to `tempDir` using the vinyl file object's relative path,
just like `gulp.dest()` writes to the output directory.
Make sure you understand how globbing works to avoid unexpected errors:
for example, the files in `gulp.src(['files/*.json', config.yml])`
will all be output at the root of `tempDir`.

Consider passing the
[`{ base: '.' }` option to `glob.src`](https://github.com/wearefractal/glob-stream#options)
if you need to output a src glob as it exists on disk.
When in doubt, log `tempDir` to the console and open it to see what's going on.
